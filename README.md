# World Engine 🌍
> "Clear your backlog. Without the headcount."

The **World Engine** is an AI-augmented workforce platform that treats technical debt as a paid asset. It connects "Solvers" (Gamified Engineers) with "Clients" (Enterprise Capital) through a real-time, neural-linked interface.

## 🏗️ Architecture (The "Mullet" Protocol)
*   **Business in the Front**: A polished, high-trust Enterprise portal for capital deployment.
*   **Party in the Back**: A high-intensity, gamified workspace for solvers.
*   **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion.

## 🎮 Core Modules

### 1. Founder's Cockpit (God Mode) 🦅
A hidden "Neural Link" dash for platform owners. Access business health metrics (MRR, Burn, Velocity) and link directly to financial rails.
*   **Access**: Click the green "Pulse" dot in the Header or use `Ctrl + Shift + G`.

### 2. Engine Sage (The Iron Dome) 🛡️
Our first line of defense. An AI support guardian that triages support requests, solves common bugs, and escalates high-value enterprise issues to humans.

### 3. The Solver Arcade
A "Matrix-style" calibration test that evaluates engineer skills via specialized puzzles, assigning an **Archetype** (e.g., *Data Striker*, *Pattern Architect*).

### 4. Enterprise Financials
Full integration with energy credit systems. Clients can deploy capital, post bounties, and track their backlog reduction in real-time.

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the local engine
npm run dev
```

## 🔐 Security & Governance
Operations under **SOC2 Type II** (Simulated). All IP transfer is atomic and verified by the Engine Guardian upon bounty payout.
